# Microgrid-data
I want to collect some data(weather conditions,Electricity prices, loads...) about Microgrid,which can  help me to optimize microgrid configuration

Here is a website that can provide some weather datas   
https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/  

Futher more,I will focus on finding some real electrical load and heating load datas
